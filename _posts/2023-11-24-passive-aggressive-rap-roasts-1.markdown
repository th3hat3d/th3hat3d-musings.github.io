title: Passive-Aggressive Rap Roasts (Still Pushin by Logic)
---

Hi there, hip-hop heads! At least, I hope y'all are. I'll be casually roasting Logic in the most passive-aggressive way I can muster through his song "Still Pushin." This is part of a (eventually ongoing) new series of posts in which I do this with various other songs and their respective artists. I aim to bring a new and (hopefully) hilarious twist to rap with these deconstructions. With that stated, let's get started.

{Intro}  
As you see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours (Logic)

*Are you sure about that? Not seeing any force from you.*

Yeah, check it, ayo  
  
{Verse}  
Pick up the brush like Picasso, '93 Nas flow  
200 on the 101, watch as the nos go (Now)  
Straight from the underground, that lost flow

*Do you ever think that the flow should've stayed lost?*

Now we get Louis V, back in the day as a kid it was Costco  
I stay breaded’ like Roscoe's

*Roscoe's is a restaurant with a 3.6 on Yelp. There were better restaurants to compare yourself to. Or is that the level at which you lie?*

Rap messiah, me and my apostles

*No one calls you that but you.*

I'm 33 but by rap years I’m fuckin' fossils  
Still kickin', still pushin', still grindin', still goin'  
Already knowing that I don't know shit

*About what, rap?*

Walk in the room, knew my intentions ‘fore I spoke it
I took the record and broke it  
Feeling limitless, I'm feeling so focused  
This is all me, nobody co-wrote this

*Yeah, we know no one co-wrote it. It shows.*

And I hope this reach you when you need it  
Not at your wit’s end, feeling depletеd

*Isn't your goal to spread peace, love, and positivity? Think we all need those at our wit's end. Are you at yours?*

Keep being you, fake motherfuckеrs we seeing through  
This some rap shit, come now feel the flow in this beat  
I’ve had my ups and downs, but life ain't ever felt this steep

*Bro, you're retired. Life ain't that steep anymore.*

Shallow moments in my career, but it’s never been this deep

*Logic finally realizes the true depth of his career. Not.*

Praise God that I'm alive, moment I wait 'til I see
Ayo, this is emceeing, finally on yolk like Koreans  
Foreseeing I would blow like C4, who want more?

*Not sure people want to experience a literal bomb again. Are you referring to your own songs?*

Me and my clique tighter than belt buckles  
This for anybody that life beat down and felt knuckles

*Oh, now it's for people at their wit's end. Which is it, Logic? Indecisive fr...*

For the Discord, pulling strings like Hendrix's ripcords

*Last time I checked, Jimi Hendrix never went bungee jumping. So you're not pulling any strings.*

(You are watching a master at work)  
Wooh, this shit crazy (Is this what you want?)  
  
{Verse 2}  
Ayo, my kicks 3G’s like an astronaut's, pass the shots

*Bro, astronauts operate at 0G. You should know that. Seems like those shots are having their desired effect.*

You stay acting funny  
Need a reality check? That's that Kardashian money  
My flow ultra, no 85  
'86 you like Reagan, no longer alive

*Pretty sure Reagan was still kicking in '86...*

Engaging in bullshit, I want no parts  
Rapping in my genes, ain't no starch  
I can rhyme without rhyming, still make the people third month  
Fifth month I continue to ensue, cut you like Ginsu

*Okay, that's a decent line. Have you sharpened it recently, though?*

You don't know the shit that I been through  
It's hard to stay present when your past was tense  
The flow is immense  
Weed hit my chest like 450 on the bench
On my MPC2000XL in the front yard

*Logic attempts to geek out about music in the middle of a song. Maybe it's not the time.*

I stay with vintage brakes like junk yards, always come hard  
Pick up the mic now En Garde  
Try hard, back with another attempt

*You didn't succeed on the first one? Pfft.*

Don't hold me exempt

*Exempt from what? Sense in your lyrics?*

Stay with bars like I was held in contempt  
Ain't fucking with you like a women ain't giving consent

*Do you have experience with that or something?*

What's the gift of life without presents?

*There's a name for that: Buddhism. You should try it sometime.*

Smoking an ounce plus the resin  
I got the throne, you got the chair

*I did, except the fact that it's an Aeron chair. So still a fine chair.*

Stay dropping the ball like Times Square

*Okay, Logic. That means I only drop the ball once a year. Happens to everyone.*

When I'm fried I lose track of time like Phil in Futurama

*ADHD brain... don't make it obvious.*

No time for the drama, only the comma, my money never pause

*You released this album for free, bro. "My money never pause" my butt.*

Rebel with a cause, sound the applause

*Didn't expect people to give applause for you naturally? Nice.*

In the cut like gauze

*Isn't gauze put outside of the cut, on the skin?*

Black and white like Hitchcock, me and the blunt lip-lock

*That's a terrible thought pattern. Also, are you seriously bringing that up again? Grow up.*

I'ma kick push, you can suck a dick and then kick rocks  
  
{Outro}  
First free mixtape in ten years  
It's Logic, pack master  
Young Sinatra, RattPack  
I love y'all, man, this whole shit straight from the heart  
Inglorious Basterd, Volume 1

*Wait, there's more of this? Ugh.*
