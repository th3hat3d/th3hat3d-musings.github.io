title: How I Got a 1570 on the SAT
---

Upon reading that title, you may be desperate for some tips on how to get that high of a score (if you are in high school and are taking the SAT). I will say: it requires a lot of hard work, effort, and perseverance. There will be a lot of frustration along the way. Let’s not waste any time. 

### The Score Breakdown

I got a 770 EBRW score and an 800 Math score. Keep in mind that this was on the May 6 SAT. I got 5 questions wrong on the reading section, a perfect score on the writing section, and a single question wrong on the math section. 

### The Journey

My school was offering an eight week prep program for the SAT, which cost $160 (a reduced price). This was relatively cheap compared to the other tutoring options I had seen (the ones that charge by the hour). My family decided to pay for the program, but to be really honest, I did not study for the SAT outside of the program at all. I did not even do the assigned homework for the program either. The last day of the class came and I was glad to be done. Test day came on March 22, and I ended up with a 1450. This was not the worst score imaginable, but I had much higher expectations for myself (especially because I wanted to go to an Ivy League). Instead of following the advice of my friends and not retaking, I started to take my studying seriously. I spent upwards of two hours studying per day using Khan Academy and took various practice tests. Along the way, I got very frustrated with the lack of improvement in my reading score while my math score was rapidly increasing. I will admit: I sobbed many, many times during my prep. Test day came again, and I came out of my testing center confident and driven. Two weeks later, I looked at my phone and screamed when I saw my score. I was happy and fulfilled; a reminder that hard work and perseverance go a long way, no matter your background.

### Reading Section Tips

Being a reader helped a lot on this section for me personally. To do well on this section, I would recommend incorporating more pleasure reading into your life. Studying for the reading section will not cover up bad general reading skills. This is especially effective if you read literature related to the **type** of passage you are weak on. For example, I was weak on natural science passages during my studying, so I picked up the book *Sapiens* to practice reading and understanding those kinds of passages. For the literature passages, focus on how the characters are **feeling**, as questions will often be reliant on you knowing the emotions in the story. Finally, for the politics passage, versing yourself well in basic American and contemporary history will go a long way. 

### Writing Section Tips

Two things for this section: basic instinct for grammar and grinding. The main way I got better at the writing section was to grind hundreds of questions, becoming familiar with the question format and style. In addition, the section relies on knowledge of English grammar, which you have likely acquired an instinct for throughout your life. Follow your ear: if something doesn’t sound right grammatically to you, it probably isn’t. I really don’t have many other tips for this section other than those two. Grind hard and follow your ear. 

### Math Section Tips

The math section is both the hardest and easiest section to improve on, depending on your skill. Math is objective and not up for interpretation, unlike the reading section. But if you are not versed in the actual high school math concepts tested, you will not do well on this section. From what I have seen, the test does not go above precalculus level material, so if you are currently taking that class (or something higher level), you should be pretty confident. If not, take a diagnostic exam and observe the areas of math you are weak in. Learn those concepts and grind hard on math questions. After enough questions, they will become almost second nature to you. 

### Mindset and Focus

Be motivated. Have the drive to do well on this exam and don’t let the “test optional” crowd discourage you. Know that your hard work will decide your result and not your background. No matter what resources you have access to, whether it be a $300 an hour tutor or Khan Academy, maximize your use of them for ultimate success. Drill into your mind the fact that the SAT is **skill based**. You can do it!

As for test day, have plenty of water and be well rested before the exam. Do whatever it takes for you to relax. Meditation, deep breaths, good luck charms, prayer, etc. This will help keep your mind clear throughout the exam and eliminate the slump which students often face during the math section. Focus on the cycle of reading and bubbling in answers. The flow state that you can achieve by doing this can help massively in terms of doing well. 

### Conclusion

My message to anyone reading this is twofold: work hard and you will achieve success on the SAT. Know your weaknesses and overcome them with whatever resources you have. I came from a low-income background and managed to obtain a similar score to high-income students who shell out thousands for tutoring. I made it through with pure hard work and motivation. You can do it too.
