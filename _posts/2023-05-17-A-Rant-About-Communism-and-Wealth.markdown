title: "A Rant About Communism and Wealth"
---

A word of warning: this is mainly a political rant in support of capitalism. Please stop reading if you are a staunch communist or just don't like rants. Thank you.

#### The Preamble

Lately, I've been seeing people complain about people richer than them. I don't mean just billionaires. Even with a smaller class gap, like working class and lower middle class, there is still resentment towards the higher class, even when the difference is not as large. I hate how people hate other folks just because they have more money than them. That's what I'm here to rant about today. 

#### "Eat The Rich"

You've probably heard that phrase before, usually in a communist context or in a critique of capitalism. I kind of hate it. It dehumanizes those more wealthy than the person proclaiming the phrase and itself is a classist phrase. Not all "rich" people are idle, lazy, conceited, or spoiled. That's simply a stereotype, and many of them do contribute (and even give back) to society in their own form, just like any working person does. When referring to those that don't (often heirs), it is fair to  dislike them, but on the basis of laziness and idleness, not wealth. 

#### The Bourgeoisie

A staple of Marxist theory, it is a word for those in privileged financial positions. But I also hate the concept of the *bourgeoisie* itself. The *bourgeoisie* encompasses those in the lower middle class to those in the highest echelons in society. It is ridiculous that a person who earns $60,000 a year and royalty should be put in the same classification. Worse, it discourages a person from attempting to move up the financial ladder, for if they move up into the lower middle class, they are now part of the privileged *bourgeoisie*. It ends up making the person feel resentful towards their financial success when they really shouldn't be, provided that they worked for it. The word also implies, in a way, that every person within it has the same high economic privilege, which is most definitely not true. 

#### The Means of Production

Yet another Marxist concept, the means of production are discussed largely in terms of who owns it: the *bourgeoisie*. But does anyone truly own the means of production? Who makes things happen in society? The answer is simple: the people. The people are the means of production. CEOs do not get rich on their own: they need employees to work for them. Without employees, a company is nothing. Also, the concept concerns itself with the very problem of the *bourgeoisie* concept I pointed out in the last section. I genuinely don't think an accountant or someone in IT helpdesk would own anything in regards to production (if we were to continue with the Marxist interpretation of who owns the means of production), despite the average incomes for those positions reaching the range of the *petite bourgeoisie*, which is absorbed into the larger *bourgeoisie*.

#### Luxury Items

This'll be a short one. Many people hate how the wealthy sometimes show off their luxury or possessions. While this can be distasteful if done excessively, the act of showing off is itself not a bad thing. Think about this question: why do people wear engagement/wedding rings? To celebrate finding a special someone in their lives, and why wouldn't people want to celebrate that? Many wealthy people didn't start off that way, and it makes sense why they would want to enjoy the money they now have. Objects like luxury cars or expensive jewelry can be trophies for them, as they have come so far in their lives. Again, this is not a bad thing if done tastefully and sparsely, except if the person did not earn their wealth themselves. 

#### The Conclusion of the Rant

That's pretty much my take on capitalism, communism, and the wealthy. Feel free to agree or disagree with me. I just want to put my thoughts out there on the Internet so people can see a different viewpoint on the subject. Thanks for reading.
